(Please don't mind if my English is broken.)

Due to an accident, my original account @ChuishenX is no longer used.

Chuishen Qiusha (吹神求杀) is my screen name. I'm a Chinese rational patriot. Learning in Hangzhou Foreign Language School as a senior high student, I'm now the co-leader and president of Team [@OblivionOcean](https://github.com/OblivionOcean). I also have a [personal blog](https://chuishen.xyz) based on Hexo where I post my "work".
